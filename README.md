# E-commerce Reviews Scraping

This Python project scrapes customer reviews from an e-commerce website (or a local HTML file) and saves the extracted data into both **CSV** and **Excel** formats. It uses libraries like **BeautifulSoup**, **Pandas**, **Requests**, and **openpyxl** to achieve this.

## Requirements

Before using this project, ensure that **Python** is installed on your machine, and the necessary libraries are set up:

1. **Python Installation**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - After installation, verify by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```
     This should print the Python version (e.g., `Python 3.x.x`).

2. **Library Installation**:
   The following Python libraries are required to run this project:
   - **pandas**: For handling and saving the scraped data.
   - **beautifulsoup4**: For parsing and extracting data from HTML.
   - **requests**: For sending HTTP requests to scrape data from a live URL.
   - **openpyxl**: For saving data to an Excel file.

   To install the required libraries, open your terminal and run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 requests openpyxl
   ```

## Usage

1. **Scraping from a Live Website**:
   - Update the `url` variable in the script with the target e-commerce website URL.
   - Run the script, and it will fetch and parse the reviews.

2. **Scraping from a Local HTML File**:
   - Save the e-commerce page as an HTML file.
   - Update the script to read from the local file instead of making an HTTP request.

3. **Saving the Data**:
   - The script extracts key information such as review text, rating, author, and date.
   - The data is then saved into both `reviews.csv` and `reviews.xlsx`.

## Example Output

A sample of the extracted data:

| Author | Rating | Review | Date |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| JohnDoe | 5 | "Great product!" | 2024-03-10 |
| JaneSmith | 4 | "Good value for money." | 2024-03-11 |

## Notes
- Ensure compliance with the website's **robots.txt** and terms of service before scraping.
- If the website uses JavaScript to load reviews dynamically, consider using **Selenium** or **Scrapy** for advanced scraping techniques.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement multi-threading for faster scraping.
- Support for additional data formats (JSON, SQLite database).
- Integration with sentiment analysis for review insights.
